Hierarchical Applications and Resources Reporting Interface
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Hierarchical Applications and Resources Reporting Interface (HARRI) project is a sub-project for the EROS migration and may soon branch out on its own. Initially, it will be developed under the EROS Migration Project and its first use case will be in assisting with tracking progress on that.

CIDA network infrastructure consists of many different machines (virtual and physical machines, databases and application servers) that are spread across many networks. Visibility into this infrastructure requires the collection and reporting of information originating from various sources (eg: network location, VM, Tomcat server, Database, and Apache configurations). HARRI will collect this information accurately (in real time), aggregate the data, and provide it to end users.
